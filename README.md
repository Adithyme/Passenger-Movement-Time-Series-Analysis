# Passenger-Movement-Time-Series-Analysis
Passenger Movement Time Series Analysis (India)

This project presents a detailed time series analysis of passenger movement between Indian airports using monthly data. The objective is to explore seasonal trends, forecast future movement patterns, and provide insights for transportation planning.
